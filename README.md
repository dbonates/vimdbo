# tmux config and vim plugins I use daily

Also, oh-my-zsh to get oh-my-zsh up and running:

> Install zsh:

`sudo apt install -y zsh`

> then upgrade it to oh-my-zsh:

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

Works better along with [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org), which can be installed with:

```
curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash
```

after clone and getting into `dbovim` and:

```
mv .tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```

and

```
mv pack/ ~/.vim/pack/
```

All the best,
    Bonates.
